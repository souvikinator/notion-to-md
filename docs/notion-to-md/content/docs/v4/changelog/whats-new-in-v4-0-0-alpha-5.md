Notion-to-md `v4.0.0-alpha.5` introduces several enhancements aimed at improving flexibility and developer experience. Here's a breakdown of the key updates:

## Enhanced Frontmatter Configuration

This release significantly improves **frontmatter handling**, making it easier to manage and modify metadata derived from Notion properties.

### What This Means For You (The Outcomes)

- **Powerful Value Transformation:** Need to format a date differently, convert tags to lowercase, or even generate a URL-friendly slug from your page title? The new `transform` option lets you apply custom logic to property values _before_ they are added to the frontmatter, giving you complete control over the final output format. [See frontmatter transform in action](../../../../blog/how-to-convert-notion-properties-to-frontmatter/#transforming-properties) and [refer to API reference](../../concepts/configuration/#mdx-renderer-configuration).
